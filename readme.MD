# Microblog Sync


This project synchronizes posts between a Telegram channel and a WordPress blog. It uses a SQLite database to store the posts and the `python-telegram-bot` library to interact with the Telegram API.



> We strongly believe that we cannot trust media controlled by billionaires. If we use them, we should also keep a copy on our own website and database. That's why we created this Python programâ€”to help you save everything you publish on your Telegram channel, both on your local machine and your WordPress site.

## Prerequisites

    - Windows, Linux, or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Windows is highly recommended  
    - Python 3.x
    - pip (Python package installer)
    - Telegram Channel
    - Telegram Bot
    - WordPress Site

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SmarterTechAustralia/microblog.git
    cd microblog
    ```

    - It is recommended to run it in a virtual environment. For example:

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv .
    ```

    - Enter your virtual environment in Linux:

    ```sh
    source bin/activate 
    ```

    - Or if you are using Windows:
    ```sh
    .\Scripts\activate
    ```

   > **_Note:_** Replace `python3` with `python` if you are on Windows.

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a [keys.yaml](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) file in the project root directory with the following structure:
     - in linux try `sudo nano keys.yaml` 

    ```yaml
    telegram:
      bot_token: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
      channel_id: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID"

    wordpress:
      urlen: "YOUR_EN_WORDPRESS_URL"
      urlfa: "YOUR_FA_WORDPRESS_URL"
      username: "YOUR_WORDPRESS_USERNAME"
      password: "YOUR_WORDPRESS_API_KEY"
    ```

4. Update your [keys.yaml](http://_vscodecontentref_/2) with Telegram Bot and WordPress credentials:
    - **Telegram Bot**:
        - You should have or create a Telegram bot and add it to your channel as an admin. Follow these steps:
            1. **Create a Telegram Bot**:
                - Open the Telegram app and search for the `@BotFather` bot.
                - Start a chat with `@BotFather` and send the command `/newbot`.
                - Follow the instructions to choose a name and username for your bot.
                - After completing the setup, `@BotFather` will provide you with a bot token. Save this token as you will need it later.

            2. **Get the Channel ID**:
                - Add your bot to the desired Telegram channel.
                - Make the bot an admin of the channel.
                - To get the channel ID, you can use the following method:
                    - Forward a message from your channel to `@userinfobot` on Telegram.
                    - `@userinfobot` will reply with information about the forwarded message, including the channel ID (it will be a negative number).

            3. **Configure the Bot**:
                - Ensure your bot has the necessary permissions to read messages and post in the channel.

            4. **Add the Bot Token and Channel ID to [keys.yaml](http://_vscodecontentref_/3)**:
                - Use the bot token and channel ID in the [keys.yaml](http://_vscodecontentref_/4) file as shown in the installation section.

    - **WordPress Site**:
        - You should have a WordPress site with an admin username and an active API key:
            1. **Set Up a WordPress Site**:
                - Ensure you have a WordPress site up and running.
                - You should have an admin username and password for your WordPress site.

            2. **Generate an API Key**:
                - Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.
                - Navigate to `Users` > `Profile`.
                - Scroll down to the `Application Passwords` section.
                - Enter a name for the application (e.g., "Microblog Sync") and click `Add New Application Password`.
                - Copy the generated API key and save it securely as you will need it later.
                - Use this API key in the [keys.yaml](http://_vscodecontentref_/5) file you have created previously.

## Usage

1. Initialize the database:

    ```sh
    python sync.py --init-db
    ```

2. Run the sync process:

    ```sh
    python sync.py
    ```

> **_Note:_** Ensure your virtual environment is activated before running the sync process.

## Running the app automatically

### On Linux

To run the app automatically using a cron job, follow these steps:

1. Open the crontab file for editing:

    ```sh
    crontab -e
    ```

2. Add a new cron job to run the sync script at your desired interval. For example, to run the script every hour, add the following line:

    ```sh
    0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/kevin/projects/microblog/sync.py
    ```

3. Save and close the crontab file. The cron job will now run the script automatically at the specified interval.

### On Windows

To run the app automatically using Task Scheduler, follow these steps:

1. Open Task Scheduler from the Start menu.

2. Click on "Create Basic Task" in the Actions pane.

3. Follow the wizard to set up the task:
    - Name: Enter a name for the task (e.g., "Microblog Sync").
    - Trigger: Choose how often you want the task to run (e.g., daily, weekly).
    - Action: Select "Start a program" and browse to the Python executable (e.g., `C:\Python39\python.exe`).
    - Add arguments: Enter the path to the sync script (e.g., `C:\Users\Kevin\projects\microblog\sync.py`).

4. Finish the wizard and the task will be created. The Task Scheduler will now run the script automatically at the specified interval.
